# multi-model-analyses

Self contained example of climate model downloader, pre-processor and multi-
model analyses.

There is no interface here, all files are bash executable. I am unable to
provide an interface.

All files include brief instructions for use.

These files are used to analyse how the climate risk hazards of:

- extreme heat
- extreme wind
- fire weather
- drought
- flood

behave in different downscaled climate models. The rcp85 scenario is used for
for all models and models are compared through timeseries plots, heatmaps and
spatial slope plots (a linear model is calculated for each grid-cell and the
value of the slope for each grid-cell is presented on the plot using colours).
